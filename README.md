### Ep Background

The “testing the microphone” half of an album is my first ever lyrical body of work. Lyrically expressing my struggles and setbacks as a result of #parentalmisguidiancelovfuly . Being just a bathroom performing artist for a long time. How I toggled thru decision making of being a career person & a #bathroomartist to become a proper recording and performing Afro beats artist.

As an individual who has suffered untold struggles  that has majorly brought about delay, some level of #Grace is needed to catch up with all of the wasted time, because grace they say is an unmerited favor that checkmates labor. 
Accompanied in this Ep project is my first ever recorded studio song project

#Olopa A commemoration song of a tragic event "October 20/2020 Lekki mascara" that claimed the lives of tens of Nigeria youth who was protesting peacefully and harmlessly for an end to police (olopa) brutality experienced in all parts of the country and a righteous plea for good governance, even with the national flag on their hands as they were shot dead without explanation or acknowledgement. How this mayhem shot down the economy of the country for weeks affecting the National GDP very negatively and the government reputation before other nations, globally.
“Olopa” fosters the need to always speak up just to remind the government of that tragic event of Oct. 20/2020. And that power actually belongs to the people (the youth), regardless. And that power too can destroy the holder and the owner if mismanaged. 
The Ep is also fleshed-up by a vocal flex,(fun/merriment track) #wotowoto explaining and confirming my sexual stamina. 
And finally, #Dancewithme expresses myself believe on my musical talent/ creativity to propel just anybody, anywhere or any time to dance with me when I drop song.
